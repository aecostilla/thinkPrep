    To play, open console in google chrome and type the following command. "newGame();"
</p>

<p>Then a number will be generated. Your goal, to guess that number between 0 and 100.

</p> 

<p> 
    To enter a number type "playerOne(your guess here);". Place your guess where it says "your guess here". Good Luck!
</p>

<p>
*Note if you type the command "counter();" you will be able to see how many attempts you have been made.
